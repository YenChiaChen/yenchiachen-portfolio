# Shooly: Automation through Dialogue

**Shooly** is an intelligent LINE chatbot designed to streamline the booking process for home cleaning and maintenance services in urban environments.

## The Objective

Home service industries often suffer from fragmented communication. Our goal was to build a "zero-interface" experience where users could schedule, pay, and track services through a platform they already use every day.

## Technical Implementation

- **NLU (Natural Language Understanding)**: Implemented a custom intent classification model using Python and Spacy to handle messy, colloquial user inputs.
- **State Machine Architecture**: Managed complex multi-step booking flows using a robust backend state machine to prevent user drop-off.
- **LINE Messaging API**: Leveraged Rich Menus and Flex Messages to create a GUI-like experience within a text bubble.

## Results

Shooly won **1st Place** at the LINE Chatbot Competition, cited for its exceptional balance of technical sophistication and immediate market utility. It demonstrated that automation doesn't have to feel robotic.
