# Fintech for the Next Generation

**PP-Bank** is a mobile application designed to gamify financial education for children, helping them understand the value of savings through a task-and-reward system.

## Designing for Young Minds

Working on a product for children required a unique approach to UX:
- **Zero Friction**: Removed complex banking jargon in favor of intuitive iconography.
- **Gamification**: Introduced "Achievements" and "Levels" to keep engagement high.
- **Parental Controls**: Built a robust secondary interface for parents to manage allowances and task verification.

## Recognition

This project was awarded the **Gold Award** at the Hua Nan FinTech Innovation Competition, recognized for its potential to bridge the financial literacy gap in primary education.
