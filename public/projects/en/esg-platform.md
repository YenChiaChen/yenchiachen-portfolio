# Sustainability at Scale

The ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) platform was developed for **Supreme Electronics** to facilitate transparent corporate reporting.

## The Challenge

In the era of climate awareness, enterprise-level transparency is no longer optional. The goal was to build a system that could aggregate massive amounts of supply chain data and present it in a digestible, high-impact visual format.

## Architectural Choices

- **Data-Driven UI**: Used D3.js integrated with React for complex emissions tracking visualizations.
- **Static-to-Dynamic**: Implemented a hybrid rendering strategy to ensure fast initial loads while maintaining real-time data filtering.
- **Accessibility**: Adhered to WCAG 2.1 guidelines to ensure reports are readable by all stakeholders.

## Outcomes

The platform successfully digitized a previously manual reporting process, reducing the report generation time by 60% and providing immediate insights into carbon footprint hotspots.
